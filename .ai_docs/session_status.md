## Critical Issue: Worker Route Not Activating

### What We Accomplished
- ✅ Worker code implemented with full routing logic and rollback mechanisms
- ✅ Worker deployed successfully (multiple versions)
- ✅ DNS switched to proxied mode (orange cloud) 
- ✅ Route pattern updated from `/*` to `/backend/*` (more specific)
- ✅ Worker functional on direct URL: `https://routing-backend.ritual-co.workers.dev/worker-health`

### Current Problem
**Worker route not intercepting ANY requests after 45+ minutes**

- ❌ `/backend/health_check` → Returns RitualX HTML (should route to Django)
- ❌ `/backend/v1/experts/` → Returns RitualX HTML (should route to Django)  
- ❌ `/worker-health` → Returns RitualX HTML (should return JSON)

### Configuration Status
- **Route Pattern**: `ritualx-dev.ritual-app.co/backend/*`
- **Zone ID**: `3e2ce72324e38b61ff1b83501f47d6d1`
- **Account ID**: `19c2ad706ef9998b3c6d9a2acc68a1fd` 
- **Worker Name**: `routing-backend`
- **Current Version**: `806307b7-55f1-4db4-b9e6-be43edd28d79`
- **DNS**: Proxied through Cloudflare (confirmed by `cf-ray` headers)

### Troubleshooting Attempted
1. Multiple deployments with trigger refreshes
2. Route pattern changes (from `/*` to `/backend/*`)
3. DNS verification (properly proxied)
4. Worker code verification (works on direct URL)
5. Multiple `wrangler triggers deploy` commands
6. Waited 45+ minutes for propagation

### Suspected Issues
Route activation failure could be due to:
1. **Zone ID mismatch** - May not match actual zone
2. **Route syntax error** - Pattern not recognized by Cloudflare
3. **Account permissions** - Route creation permissions missing
4. **Cloudflare routing conflict** - Existing configuration blocking worker routes
5. **Internal Cloudflare issue** - Platform-side routing problem

### Next Steps Required
1. **Verify Zone ID** - Confirm `3e2ce72324e38b61ff1b83501f47d6d1` is correct for `ritualx-dev.ritual-app.co`
2. **Check Cloudflare Dashboard** - Manually verify worker routes in CF dashboard
3. **Alternative approaches** - Consider Page Rules or different routing methods
4. **Support escalation** - May need Cloudflare support if configuration is correct

### Current Working Configuration
```toml
# wrangler.toml
account_id = "19c2ad706ef9998b3c6d9a2acc68a1fd"

[[routes]]
pattern = "ritualx-dev.ritual-app.co/backend/*"
zone_id = "3e2ce72324e38b61ff1b83501f47d6d1"
```

### Commands to Resume
```bash
# Check deployments
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=19c2ad706ef9998b3c6d9a2acc68a1fd wrangler deployments list

# Test worker status
curl https://routing-backend.ritual-co.workers.dev/worker-health

# Test routing (currently failing)
curl https://ritualx-dev.ritual-app.co/backend/health_check
```

### Rollback Status
- **No immediate action needed** - Main site functioning normally
- **Worker can be disabled** - Set `ROUTING_ENABLED=false` if needed
- **DNS can be reverted** - Switch back to grey cloud if required

### Key Learning
Route configuration appears correct but worker routes are not activating. This suggests a deeper Cloudflare configuration issue that requires investigation beyond standard deployment procedures.
