# Session History & Decisions

## Session Date: 2025-06-25

### Objective
Implement Cloudflare Worker to route `/backend/*` requests from `ritualx-dev.ritual-app.co` to `management-dev.ritual-app.co` Django backend.

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Routing Rules Confirmed**
   - `ritualx-dev.ritual-app.co/backend/v1/experts/` → `management-dev.ritual-app.co/v1/experts/`
   - `ritualx-dev.ritual-app.co/backend/health_check` → `management-dev.ritual-app.co/health_check`
   - All other paths pass through unchanged

2. **Rollback Strategy Implemented**
   - Environment variable toggle: `ROUTING_ENABLED=false`
   - Health check endpoint: `/worker-health`
   - Upstream failure fallback with try-catch
   - DNS rollback option (grey cloud)

3. **Safety-First Deployment Approach**
   - Deployed health-check-only version first
   - Tested worker functionality on direct URL
   - Verified Django backend accessibility
   - Implemented full routing with rollback ready

### Backend Validation Results
- `https://management-dev.ritual-app.co/health_check` → `{}` (success)
- `https://management-dev.ritual-app.co/v1/experts/` → 401 (auth required, but reachable)
- `https://management-dev.ritual-app.co/v1/` → 404 (expected, no API listing)
- **Decision**: 4xx responses are acceptable - focus on successful routing

### Technical Implementation

#### Worker Code Features
- Hostname-based routing (only `ritualx-dev.ritual-app.co`)
- Path-based routing (`/backend/*` prefix removal)
- Environment variable control (`ROUTING_ENABLED`)
- Health check endpoint (`/worker-health`)
- Error handling with fallback
- Header and body preservation

#### Configuration
- **Account ID**: `19c2ad706ef9998b3c6d9a2acc68a1fd` (Ritual.co)
- **Zone ID**: `3e2ce72324e38b61ff1b83501f47d6d1` (confirmed)
- **Route Pattern**: `ritualx-dev.ritual-app.co/*`
- **Worker Name**: `routing-backend`

### Deployment History
1. **First Deployment**: Health check only (2c0ab2df-ab43-4b63-b8c3-f9a7c6f65560)
2. **Second Deployment**: Full routing (10cb43a6-ce5b-4fca-bfef-f14c12de49bb)
3. **Triggers Updated**: Route configuration redeployed

### Current Status
- ✅ Worker deployed and functional
- ✅ Health check working on direct URL
- ✅ Full routing logic implemented
- ❌ DNS routing not active (domain uses grey cloud)

### Issue Identified
- Domain `ritualx-dev.ritual-app.co` resolves to `34.160.18.209` (GCP CDN)
- Uses DNS-only mode (grey cloud), bypassing Cloudflare proxy
- Worker cannot intercept requests without proxied mode (orange cloud)

### Next Steps Required
1. Switch DNS to proxied mode (orange cloud)
2. Monitor for SSL/CORS issues
3. Validate routing functionality
4. Implement monitoring and alerts

### Research Completed
- Comprehensive analysis of DNS-only → Proxied migration risks
- SSL/TLS certificate considerations
- CORS implications and solutions
- Performance impact assessment
- Rollback strategies documented

### Tools and Commands Used
```bash
# Deployment
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=19c2ad706ef9998b3c6d9a2acc68a1fd wrangler deploy

# Testing
curl https://routing-backend.ritual-co.workers.dev/worker-health
curl https://ritualx-dev.ritual-app.co/worker-health
curl https://management-dev.ritual-app.co/health_check

# Diagnostics
dig ritualx-dev.ritual-app.co
wrangler deployments list
wrangler triggers deploy
```

### Lessons Learned
1. DNS configuration is critical for worker routing
2. Testing on direct worker URL validates code before DNS switch
3. Backend validation should ignore 4xx responses (focus on connectivity)
4. Comprehensive rollback planning is essential for production changes
5. Documentation and monitoring are crucial for complex deployments

### Files Created
- `src/index.ts` - Worker implementation with routing logic
- `.ai_docs/project_overview.md` - Project documentation
- `.ai_docs/migration_plan.md` - DNS migration procedures
- `.ai_docs/troubleshooting_guide.md` - Issue resolution guide
- `.ai_docs/session_history.md` - This file

### Environment Setup
- Wrangler CLI: v4.21.2
- Node.js project with TypeScript
- Vitest for testing (tests not yet written)
- Multiple wrangler config files (cleanup needed)

### Outstanding Tasks
- [x] Execute DNS migration to proxied mode  
- [x] Update route pattern to be specific (`/backend/*`)
- [x] Deploy worker with backend-only routing
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Investigate why worker routes not activating
- [ ] Verify Zone ID configuration in Cloudflare dashboard
- [ ] Write comprehensive routing tests
- [ ] Clean up configuration files
- [ ] Add circuit breaker pattern
- [ ] Add gradual routing controls
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts

### Session End Status
**Issue**: Worker routes not intercepting requests despite correct configuration and 45+ minutes of troubleshooting. Worker functional on direct URL but route pattern `ritualx-dev.ritual-app.co/backend/*` not activating.

**Next session priority**: Investigate zone configuration and route activation issues.
